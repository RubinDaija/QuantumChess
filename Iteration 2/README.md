                                               Connecting the Past with the Future

The Description:
Quantum Chess is visually the same as traditional chess, however with a few add-on's. The  game play will be different since we will use some characteristics of Quantum Mechanics into our game. The first and most important feature of all that will be incorporated is quantum super positioning, this is illustrated by the example of Schrodinger's cat. This feature will be implemented such that at a certain specific event when the piece is moved into another tile, it will actually be in both tiles (the previous and the one chosen now). Then it depends on how the wave function will collapse leading to the real position of the piece. Furthermore there will be the effort to implement other characteristics like quantum entanglement in a way which will make the game more "fun" . Moreover the game will be a two player game on the same system, meaning that functions like two players over the internet or playing against a computer opponent will not be implemented.
